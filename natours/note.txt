Environment variable:
Node JS ar runs in different environments. for example: development environment and production environment.
There are some other environments too.

1. by default express sets the environment to development environment:

2. to see that console.log(app.get('env')) // development. This is the environment of express.JS

3. but nodejs itself has some other environment: to see that console.log(process.env) // lot of environments.

4. These environments are come from the process core module.

5. if we want to change the environment in our node application then type this in the terminal: NODE_ENV=development nodemon server.js | when our application is ready then we have to change the environment to production.

6. we also use environment variables to configuration our application. for example: username, password, database URL etc.
so it's not a good idea to change the environment in the terminal. instead of the we can create a file name: config.env

7. the variable name will always be in uppercase and we set the variable name using this pattern: NAME=your_name

8. To use the environment variables we need to install a NPM package name dotenv.

9. after installing the NPM package we need to to require the the package and locate the file: like this
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config({ path: './config.env' })

npm install eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-node eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react parcel-bundler prettier -D
